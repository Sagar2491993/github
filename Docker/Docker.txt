Docker (devops hint marathi)

introduction docker  =  
1.  docker is one of the most popoular tools for containerization.
2.  doctker containers are lightweight,  a single sever or virctual machine can run sereral container simultaneously.
3.  docker implements hight level API to provide lightweight container that run processes in isoltion.

what is Docker = 
1.  docker is open platform for devloper and sysadins to build ship and run distributed application
2.  main principle of docker are build anywhee ship anywhere, and run anywhere (any platform)
3.  docker has a multiple components like docker engine, docker image, docker container and docker hub

advantage s of Docker = 
1. no pre-allocation of RAM
2.  less cost
3.  it is light weight
4.  it can on pytsical H/W / virtual H/w or cloud
5.  you can reuse the image

Disadvantages of docker
1.  Docker is a not good solution for application that requires rich GUI
2.  difficlt to manage large amount of container
3.  docker does not provide cross- platform compatibity
4.  no solution for data recovery and backup

Architecture of docker =
                    [ Docker Host/server]    [Registry]
client docker build  [ docker daemon         [ public,
docker run            container,               private
docker ship             imahe          ]              ]


Docker file = 
1. docker file is basically used for build the docker image
2. dDocker file is a textfile and contains list of command (set of instruction)

Docker Image  =
1. Docker file is a read only file its used to excute code in a docker container
2. to docker image as a container
3. docker run hello world

Docker container =
1.  docker container are the solution of the problem how to get software to run reliably when move fro one 
     one computing environment to another
2.  docker container are lightweight and standalone
3.  docker container runs on docker engine
